# ♟️ ChessVar — A Chess Variant

A two-player, terminal-based chess game with a unique win condition:  
**Capture all of your opponent’s pieces of a single type to win.**

---

## Overview

This is a chess variant that runs in the terminal via `ChessVar.py`.  
The board is printed with `"________"` as empty squares and displays pieces using their color (`B` or `W`) and type (`Pawn`, `Knight`, etc.).

- There is **no check or checkmate** — instead, eliminate all of one piece type from your opponent to win the game!

  - Player 1 (white team) will go first. Type column name (a - h) in lowercase letters followed by row name (1-8).
  - Example - First line: "From: a2" Second line: "To: a3"
  - Player 2 (black team) will go next. Same idea as player 1 with moves.
  - Repeat until someone wins!
